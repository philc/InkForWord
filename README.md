# InkForWord

A 2006 tablet PC addin for Microsoft Word, written for undergrad HCI research. It's now defunct.

See this [demo video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz5S7Rl7XZQ) and
[here](https://philc.github.io/InkForWord) for an overview.

I don't have the source code, but I've included the original website.
